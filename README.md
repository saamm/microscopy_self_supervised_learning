Self-supervised learning on biological images : Representation Learning for Image-based Drug Profiling in High-Content Microscopy 

## Project Objective:
Can self-supervised representation learning on microscopy images recover biologically meaningful groupings of cellular perturbations without labels?

Optional sub-questions:
1. Do SSL embeddings cluster by perturbation?
2. Are they better than PCA / autoencoders?
3. Which phenotypes are confused?

## Data :
Experiments were conducted on a subset of the BBBC021 dataset consisting of three plates from Week 1.
